# Installation
## npm:

```

You may have to run

``` bash
grunt wiredep
```

to make grunt automatically add the needed files to your `index.html`.

## Manually:
Clone or [download](https://github.com/simeg/ngjs-color-picker/archive/master.zip) the repository and include the production file in your application.

``` html
<script type="text/javascript" src="dist/ngjs-color-picker.js"></script>
```

Inject the directive as a dependency in your app:

``` javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['ngjsColorPicker']);
```

# Usage and documentation
For documentation, examples and usage see the [GitHub page for this repository](http://simeg.github.io/ngjs-color-picker).

## Option prioritization
1. Custom colors
2. Random colors
3. Gradient
4. Default colors

# Contribute :raised_hands:
Run `npm install` and then you're able to start dev server with
``` bash
npm run serve
```

The server is then available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

The file `dev/app/ngjs-color-picker.js` is a symlink to `source/ngjs-color-picker.js`, so you can edit either one of them and the change will be shown on the dev server.

(Development server environment created using awesome [angular-webpack](https://github.com/preboot/angular-webpack)).

# TODO
* **See [issues](https://github.com/simeg/ngjs-color-picker/issues)**
* Click (or something) to get the hex-code for the color (rgb should also be available)
* Add reverse option for gradient
* Include color themes (Good palettes: http://jsfiddle.net/nicgirault/bqph3pkL/)
* Add option to select rows instead of columns
